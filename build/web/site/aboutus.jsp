                                The BookPortal Bookstore is the surprising small town bookstore. Located in beautiful Grand Rapids, Minnesota, we have been an independent bookseller for over 30 years. Regional books are our specialty. We offer a large selection of titles relating to Minnesota history, biographies, outdoor activities, nature, and much more.
